## About us üëª

**IoT-Hotspot** It is a simple platform that applies Internet of Things (IoT) technology, strengthening it with a bit of statistics and an algorithm for machine learning (AI) focused on failure prediction and telemetry analysis of data collected by the devices, using two prototype cards called (CRD and ERB), with these it was possible to give 2 novel solutions to machines that required to communicate their current and operational status through the use of adaptable hardware, allowing their machines to send data to the cloud, Our intention is to allow these alternative solutions to be replicated in other possible projects of a similar nature and thus contribute to the world by interconnecting electronic devices to the cloud. üòè Visit the solution [IoT-Hotspot](https://hotspot.fjlic.com), or contact [soporte@fjlic.com](https://github.com/fjlic).
