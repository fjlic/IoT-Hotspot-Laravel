## Install Command

After requiring the package via `composer`, all you have to do is to run a single command which will take care of publishing the needed assets and configurations.

```php
php artisan larecipe:install
```

After running the command you will find a few changes in your Laravel app folders: the `larecipe.php` config file will be added to your `config` directory and the basic setup for writing documentation will be added to the `resources/docs` directory. That happened internally by calling `larecipe:docs` command inside `larecipe:install` command.

> {warning} This structure is based on the default path of the docs. Yours will be different if you change the docs `path`.

```php
.
â”œâ”€ config
â”‚  â””â”€ larecipe.php
â””â”€ resources
   â””â”€ docs
      â””â”€ 1.0
         â”‚â”€ index.md
         â””â”€ overview.md
       
```

## Docs Command

This command is a bit more complicated than `larecipe:install` command. However, all you have to know is the behavior of this command and what you expect from it.

```php
php artisan larecipe:docs
```

> {primary} The workflow of this command is:

1. LaRecipe will read the published versions array in your `config/larecipe`.
2. For each published version, LaRecipe will create the corresponding version directory if not exists.
3. After creating the directory, LaRecipe will create `index.md` for the given version if not exists.
4. Finally, LaRecipe will create `overview.md` for the given version if not exists.
