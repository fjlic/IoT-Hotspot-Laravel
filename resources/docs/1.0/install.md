## Using IoT-Hotspot üî∞

### Before we start we give you the following suggestions.. üëÄ

It is important that you consider what your work environment will be, whether for production or locally, we recommend that your team, whether physical or virtualized, have at least 2 cores, 2 gigabytes of ram + about 60 gigabytes of ssd storage. If you choose to use a space in the cloud like a professional ü§ò, It applies in the same way since most companies that offer vps services have this configuration, we also recommend the AWS services of Amazon, Digital Ocean, IONOS 1and1 or any other.

> {warning} Note. For the project to start, it requires certain previous tools ‚úã

1. Php version 7.4 [`Php`](https://www.php.net/releases/7_4_0.php).
2. Composer version 2.1 [`Composer`](https://getcomposer.org/).
3. Maria DB version 10.4 [`MariaDB`](https://mariadb.org/).
4. Apache 2 [`Servidor Web`](https://httpd.apache.org/) o Nginx [`Servidor Web`](https://www.nginx.com/).
5. If you don't want to complicate yourself raising a service [`LEMP`](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-linux-nginx-mysql-php-lemp-stack-on-ubuntu-20-04-es) o [`LAMP`](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-linux-apache-mysql-php-lamp-stack-on-ubuntu-20-04-es) better install [`XAMPP`](https://www.apachefriends.org/es/index.html).
